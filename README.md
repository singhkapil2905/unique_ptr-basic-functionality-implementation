# unique_ptr-basic-functionality-implementation
This repository shows implementation of basic functionalities provided by std::unique_ptr single object version. Need to implement custom deleter and make_unique()


my_unique_ptr.h contains the implementation of unique_ptr.
test_uptr.cpp contains the test cases used to verify correctness of implementation and illustrate the usage (which is exactly same as std::unique_ptr)
